Welcome to this [simple DSQI calcuator!](http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~dkibrahi/dsqi/index.html) DSQI is a measure of a programs design structure and efficiency of modules. For DSQI to be calculated, it will need the following values: S1 value, which represents the total number of modules a program has; S2 value, which represents the number of modules that rely on correct data input from the source or for produce data to be used elsewhere; S3 value, which represents the number of modules that rely on prior processing; S4 value, which represents the number of database items; S5 value, which represents the total number of unique database items; S6 value, which represents the total number of segments in the database; S7 value which represents the number of modules with a single entry and exit point; And whether or not the program uses distinct method or not (more information can be found on the website). 

Then, these S-values will be recalculated as D-values (D-values are just S-values put through a formula to calculate DSQI). The user will have the option of giving a weight as to the importance to each D-value. Then, the associated weight will be multiplied by the D-value and summed to calculate DSQI.
